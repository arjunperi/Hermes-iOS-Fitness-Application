Hermes is an iOS app that helps people find & log public sports fields while also tracking their fitness statistics. The app shows nearby basketball and tennis courts as well as soccer, football, and track fields, along with many other facilities on a map view database. Hermes extends the social components of playing sports past the end of the game and into the mobile world. Users can pin, rate, and explore various facilities; log statistics, leave reviews, see hours of operation, and much more. In addition, the app tracks customizable fitness metrics such as steps taken, calories burned, and distance traveled so that users can see which locations yield the best workouts. 


Some of the technologies & frameworks used include: 
- MapKit
- HealthKit
- CoreLocation
- CoreData
